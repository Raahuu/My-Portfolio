 >
 > * [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer "Install Live Server to VSCode") to open current folder in a local server
 >
 > * [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode "Install Prettier to VSCode") to tidy up my code while programming (optional)
